                    <p>
                    During the Summer of 2022 from June 2022 - August 2022, I had the oppurtunity to partcipate in the <i>New Technologist Program </i>that is hosted with a partnership between <i>Cyborg Mobile and Microsoft </i>. During this program, I worked within an amazing team of 5 individuals whereby we set out to design a web application later come to be known as
                    <b> Goal Pal.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal with this application was to create a platform for students that would be able to support their growth at both a personal level and a community level. 
                        <b> Goal Pal</b> 
                        is a web application that provides a platform for college students to go in order to get the empowerment and encouragement that they may need to set goalsl, work towards those goals and finally achieve them. This app provides a goal-oriented and positivity-centric platform for users to achieve such.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main goal behind this application is to tackle a bigger problem which is that college students of today are the future leaders of tomorrow and it is important that we help students at such an important stage in life to achieve and implement the necessary goal-oriented habits such that they can one day lead society to greatness.
                    </p>

                    <h4> How does this App work?</h4>

                    <p> 
                        Goal Pal is a web application that is community based and thus once users have created an account or signed in, they will be assigned to a community based off of their university/college which their feed will be based off of. When users log into the app, they are prompted with a <i> check-in </i> page that will collect user data based off of how the user is feel and what is causing this feeling.
                        After check-in, the user is then given access to their feed page which contains goals and kudos posted by other users within their community. <i> Kudos </i> refers to words of support the users can post to other users within their community. 
                        Images of the app can be seen below:
